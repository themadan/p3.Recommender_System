        "* Doesn’t need anything else except users’ historical preference on a set of items. Because it’s based on historical data, the core assumption here is that the users who have agreed in the past tend to also agree in the future. In terms of user preference, it usually expressed by two categories. Explicit Rating, is a rate given by a user to an item on a sliding scale, like 5 stars for Titanic. This is the most direct feedback from users to show how much they like an item. Implicit Rating, suggests users preference indirectly, such as page views, clicks, purchase records, whether or not listen to a music track, and so on. In this article, I will take a close look at collaborative filtering that is a traditional and powerful tool for recommender systems.\n",
